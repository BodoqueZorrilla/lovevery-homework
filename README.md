## Starting 🚀

_I decided to use git flow to manage the branches_

To start the project use:
Run the project in Xcode

### Tasks 📋

1. **Fetch API from https://abraxvasbh.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com**
2. **Show all messages**
3. **Show messages by User**
4. **Post messages**

## Additional Requirements: 📦 ⚙️
1. **Handler errors**
2. **Show all messages by Topic**
3. **Design App**


### Thoughts and roadmap 💭
After read the requirements of the application, and known the app was about messages, the first thing I though was all the messaging apps that I use like messages of apple, slack, messenger of Facebook and WhatsApp.

I decided to make a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/REk49ZF5Hcet2vcXRtCdxs/Lovevery-HW?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=c0rkjEzQj8ltYhXm-1) accordingly with the research I made of the applications. 
I decided to make a clean design.

Second I made a collection on insomnia for test the API.
This help me to explore all the apis and know the return of the data. 

Finally I started to develop the application


## Folders:
**Architecture MVVM**
 - ViewModel: Handler all the business logic, connect the model with the View
 - View: Shows the components who is going to see the user
 - Models: The Model represents simple data.
